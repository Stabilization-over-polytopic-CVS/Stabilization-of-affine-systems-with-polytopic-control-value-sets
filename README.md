# Stabilization of affine systems with polytopic control value sets
This repository contains the script to generate the phase portrait given in the paper [Stabilization of affine systems with polytopic control value sets](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2112.02451). Such phase portrait correspond to an affine system on the 2-dimensional plane with feedback controls restricted to a triangle.
