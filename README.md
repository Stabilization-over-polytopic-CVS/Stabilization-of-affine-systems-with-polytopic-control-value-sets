# Stabilization of affine systems with polytopic control value sets
This repository contains the script to generate the phase portrait given in the paper [Stabilization of affine systems with polytopic control value sets](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2112.02451). Such phase portrait correspond to an affine system on the 2-dimensional plane with feedback controls restricted to a triangle.

To generate the plot before, download the script [phase_portrait.py](./phase_portrait.py) and run the command:
```
> python3.9 phase_portrait.py
```
This plot was generated in the terminal under the Debian GNU/Linux 11 system.
